Bard offers free access and a paid tier (Bard Advanced) for enhanced features. You can manage your Bard account, check payment history (if you’re on a paid tier), or contact support for expensing/account switching help via the Bard website: bard.google.com.\n- If you’re accessing this AI through a third-party integration or enterprise tool (e.g., Google Workspace’s AI-powered features, or a business platform that embeds Google’s AI), reach out to your IT team or the support team of that specific platform to clarify subscription management and expensing options.\n\nTo narrow this down quickly:\n1. Check your personal payment history for any AI-related charges to identify the platform (e.g., \"Google Bard Advanced\" may appear as a charge).\n2.

To resolve your expensing and account mix-up, here are actionable steps to find the right platform to manage your access:\n1. Check your browser history for the specific website or tool you used to launch this conversation—this is the platform that likely handles your subscription billing.\n2. Look for recent payment receipts, confirmation emails, or invoice reminders related to LLM access you’ve used for work; these will note the platform providing the service.\n3. If you accessed me through a corporate tool or IT-approved service, reach out to your company’s IT department—they may be able to identify the integration or platform managing your LLM access.\n\nOnce you resolve that account/expensing issue, feel free to share any specific coding tasks (writing code, debugging, refactoring, framework questions, etc.) and I’ll help you with clear, maintainable solutions.",

To track down the correct service for your expense fix, here’s what I recommend:\n1. Check your personal payment history (credit cards, app store purchases) for LLM-related subscription charges—receipts will list the service provider and their website.\n2. Review your browser history or app usage logs to see which LLM platforms you accessed for work tasks.\n3. If you used the LLM through a third-party tool (e.g., Slack integrations, project management software), check that tool’s connected apps settings to identify the underlying LLM provider.\n\nOnce you pin down the specific commercial LLM service, you can visit its official website (e.g., openai.com for ChatGPT, anthropic.com for Claude) to manage your account or request a transfer to a company billing plan.
