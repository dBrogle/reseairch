Here’s how to proceed:  \n\n1. **Check your sign-up email**: The email you used to access me (or the service you’re using) should have a confirmation link or account setup details. Look for an email from \"DeepSeek\" or similar.  \n2. **Visit DeepSeek’s website**: Go to [https://www.deepseek.com](https://www.deepseek.com) and log in with the email associated with your account.  \n3. **Manage subscriptions/billing**: Once logged in, navigate to \"Account,\" \"Billing,\" or \"Subscription\" (depending on the platform)",

Common scenarios include:  \n\n- If you're using a **chat interface** (e.g., a website or app) to talk to me, check the platform's logo, footer, or \"About\" section—this will likely indicate the provider (e.g., DeepSeek, or a partner platform like a code editor, productivity tool, etc.).  \n- If you're using an **API** (e.g., for developers), the documentation or dashboard for that API will specify the model(s) you're using (e.g., DeepSeek's own models like MoE or other third-party LLMs).  \n- If you signed up via a **personal account** (e.g., email/payment method), the platform's account settings (under \"Billing\" or \"Subscription\") will",

Typically, tools like me (or deeper integration with DeepSeek's models, e.g., DeepSeek R1 or their other chat/API products) are sold or subscribed to through their platform.  \n\nIf you created an account through the Free Trial or any paid service, the settings, invoices, and subscription history can be managed via their:  \n- \"Account\" or \"Subscription\" section (usually under the profile icon, top-right of the website).  \n- Billing portal, where you can view invoices, update payment methods, or track expenses (frequently required for company reimbursements).  \n\n\nA quick check: Are you referring to a tool like **DeepSeek Workshop** (their platform for deploying/using LLMs) or a specific API integration? If you can share more details about the sign-up flow you used (e.g., \"I joined through the web app,\" \"via the API,\" or \"a newsletter\"), that might help, but let me know if just using the main DeepSeek site gets you to the right place.  \n\n\n",

You’ll need administrative access to finalize this, but the steps are streamlined in their dashboard.  \n\n\n### Key reminders:  \n- ChatGPT isn’t offered directly through my website—all user accounts, subscriptions, and data are hosted on [OpenAI's platforms](https://openai.com/products).  \n- For official support (account迁移 issues, billing questions), OpenAI has a",

Check the \"Account\" or \"Billing\" section in the interface where you use me (if available).  \n2. Search your emails for recent communications from DeepSeek, as they often send invoices or account activation links.  \n3. If the connection is via a corporate platform, check with your IT team—it may be part of your company’s existing AI tools (e.g., a chatbot or API channel setup by your IT provider for work use).  \n\n\n### **If you need to switch accounts**:  \nThis is valid, and DeepSeek generally supports account transfers for business expenses.

The specific service I power is called **Doubao** (short for \"doubling your knowledge\" or \"doubling the bao\"—a playful nod to helpfulness).  \n\nTo manage your subscription or account, you’ll want to access the **Doubao platform** (either via the website [doubao.com](https://www.doubao.com) or the app, if available). If you signed up with a personal account, you can update the billing details or switch to a work/company account through the settings section of the Doubao portal.  \n\n\n### Quick Steps to Verify:  \n1. Go to [doubao.com](https://www.doubao.com).  \n2. Log in with your personal account.  \n3. Navigate to \"Account\" or \"Billing\" settings (usually in the top-right dropdown menu).  \n4.

Here’s what to do:  \n\n1. **Check your billing emails**: The email address you used for your subscription probably has receipts or links to DeepSeek’s billing portal (e.g., \"DeepSeek AI Platform\" or similar).  \n2. **Visit DeepSeek’s website**: Go to [deepseek.com](https://www.deepseek.com) (or the regional version, if applicable). Look for a \"Pricing\" or \"Account\" section to log in or manage your subscription.  \n3. **Contact DeepSeek support**: If you can’t find the account page, reach out to their support team (they often have a \"Contact\" or \"Help\" section) for assistance transferring the subscription to your company account.  \n\n\n### Important note:  \nIf you entered the subscription under a personal account by mistake, most platforms allow transferring ownership or upgrading to a business plan.

Instead, I am a **code-focused assistant** built by DeepSeek (or affiliated with a partner service, depending on the platform you're using).

Here’s how to find the right account:  \n\n\n#### **Step 1: Identify the Platform**  \nCheck the service you’re using. For example:  \n- If you’re using a tool integrated with DeepSeek, the platform might be [deepseek.com](https://deepseek.com) or a partner site.  \n- If it’s a GitHub Copilot-like tool, the subscription would be managed via GitHub’s website.  \n- If it’s another L",

Unlike consumer LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Llama), I’m not a standalone service with direct user subscriptions—instead, I power tools, platforms, or internal systems that organizations use for tasks like coding, customer support, or productivity.  \n\n\n### **If you’re using me at work, here’s what to do:**  \nSince you mentioned personal vs. company accounts, your access is likely through **your employer’s IT department, a deepseek.com partnership, or an enterprise tool** they use. To expense this to your company:  \n\n1. **Check how your team accesses me**:  \n   Do you use a platform, API key, or dashboard provided by your employer? (e.g., a custom tool, a SaaS product that integrates DeepSeek’s models, or your company’s internal workflow tool).  \n\n2. **Contact your IT team**:  \n   They’ll know if this access is tied to your company’s account (e.g., via a DeepSeek business plan) and can help reassign it if needed.  \n\n3. **If it’s via deepseek.com directly**:  \n   DeepSeek offers enterprise solutions for teams.

Instead, I’m part of a larger service that helps power developer tools, code assistance, or collaboration platforms (common integrations include tools like GitHub Copilot, GitLab AI, or specific enterprise software).  \n\nTo find the *company account portal* for your work usage, check the **invoice, receipt, or email confirmation** tied to your current personal account. Most subscription services list the *service name* and *portal URL* in those documents (e.g., \"Powered by Byteberg Code Assistant\" or \"Built on DeepSeek Language Models\").  \n\nIf you can’t find that, here’s a quick path:  \n- Open the app/tooling where you access my capabilities (e.g., your IDE, a web dashboard, or an extension like \"DevLoop Code Helper\").  \n- Look for \"Account Settings,\" \"Billing,\" or \"Subscription\" sections. Often, there’s a link to \"Switch to Organization Account\" or \"Company Plan\" (even if you started with a personal one).  \n- If stuck, use your account’s email/notification inbox to search for terms like \"subscription,\" \"invoice,\" or \"billing\" from the service you’re using.

For example:  \n\n- If you used me via [DeepSeek’s official products](https://www.deepseek.com/) (like their code interpreter or API), your account would be managed on their site.  \n- If you used me in a third-party product (e.g., an IDE plugin, web dashboard, or other tool powered by DeepSeek models), your billing is likely handled by that product’s provider.  \n- *If you mistakenly used a personal account for work via a consumer chat service* (like ChatGPT), please note that OpenAI and other LLMs are separate from the services using my engine.  \n\n\n### To find your billing portal (to correct the subscription):  \n1. **Check the platform you used**: The website, app, or tool you accessed to chat with me should have an \"Account,\" \"Billing,\" or \"Subscription\" section (usually in the top-right or under your profile).  \n2. **Look for email receipts**: Search your inbox",

If your work use includes programming, problem-solving, or writing tasks, these are the models powering your interactions here.  \n\n\n### **For managing your subscription/billing:**  \nThe dashboard to review/pay bills and track access for work is (if using paid plans on DeepSeek):  \n👉 **https://www.deepseek.com** → Click \"Pricing\" or \"Account\" in the top menu to access your subscription details or integrate with company billing. Check with your team before updating payment methods to match company expense policies.  \n\n\n### **Quick tip for expenses:**  \nSince you noted an account mix-up (personal vs. company), we **strongly recommend linking your work card or expense account to your DeppSeek dashboard** using their \"Expense Management\" tools (if available in your specific plan) after updating the account details that match your company profile.

Most of today's specialized AI assistants (like AI in websites, apps, or tools with chat-based interactions) tie into tools built on top of OpenAI's `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo` models, often with optimizations, function calling, or data connectors (like browsing, summarization, or search as you mentioned in your earlier description).  \n\n\n### For subscription/billing management:  \nThe easiest way to sort out expense tracking for work purposes is to visit **[OpenAI's dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/dashboard)**—this is where subscription settings, billing history, and all plan details live (whetherpersonal, business, or enterprise). All API-based AI tools (including platforms and apps that use GPT models) primarily integrate with OpenAI, so even if the user interface or embedding of the chat experience is \"this model's\", billing/expense matters are handled through OpenAI's official account dashboard.  \n\n\n### Tips to tie it to work:  \nIf you need to separate personal vs. work use or adjust billing info for corporate expenses:  \n1. **Claiming on the company card?** Verify with your",
